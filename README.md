# COVID19-Tracker
 
 This is a personal project I created to help people visualize data and statistics about COVID19 better. 
 
 This project uses Bootstrap, jQuery and Datatables, together with the COVID19 API from http://covid19api.com/ built by <a href="https://twitter.com/ksredelinghuys">Kyle Redelinghuys</a>. Data is originally sourced from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins CSSE</a>
 
 Please feel free to share this if you find it helpful. You may reach me at http://twitter.com/iskolares
 
 Cheers and keep safe!
